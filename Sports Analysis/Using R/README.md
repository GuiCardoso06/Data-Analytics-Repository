## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze **individual player performance** using event-based data
- Compare playing styles and tactical structures of PSG and Manchester City
- Visualize defensive actions, movement patterns, dribbling efficiency, passing networks, and expected goals (xG)
- Demonstrate the value of data visualization in football performance analysis

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### Tools & Technologies
- **R**
- Data visualization libraries (e.g. `ggplot2`)
- Football event data (passes, shots, dribbles, defensive actions, positioning)

All visualizations were generated with a **white background** and later overlaid on a football pitch to improve interpretability and realism.

## ⚽ Individual Analyses

### Leandro Paredes – Defensive Actions
- Analysis of interceptions, tackles, and duels
- Spatial dispersion of defensive actions across the pitch
- Highlights his versatility and large defensive coverage
- Identifies potential physical overload due to extensive movement

---

### Rodri – Movement & Positional Influence
- Trajectory map showing movement patterns
- Heatmap highlighting zones of highest activity
- Confirms his role as a **central defensive midfielder**
- Acts as a positional anchor supporting build-up play

---

### Lionel Messi vs Raheem Sterling – Dribbling Effectiveness
- Comparison of successful vs unsuccessful dribbles
- Differentiation using color and shape
- Findings:
  - Sterling attempted more dribbles but with lower success
  - Messi achieved higher dribbling efficiency (100% success rate)

## 🧩 Team-Level Analyses

### Average Team Positioning
- Calculation of average player positions for both teams
- Use of **Convex Hull** to represent team shape and occupied space
- Tactical systems identified:
  - Manchester City: 4-3-3
  - PSG: 4-2-3-1

---

### Passing Networks
- Visualization of accurate vs inaccurate passes
- Manchester City:
  - Strong central circulation
  - Heavy involvement of Rodri in build-up
- PSG:
  - Preference for wide play
  - Less central circulation

---

### Expected Goals (xG) Map
- Spatial distribution of shots
- Aggregation of xG values per team
- Manchester City:
  - More goal-scoring opportunities
  - Attacks concentrated in one half
- PSG:
  - Fewer chances but distributed across both halves

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Individual roles strongly influence team dynamics
- Manchester City shows structured central control and buildup
- PSG relies more on wide areas and offensive creativity
- xG analysis reveals differences in chance quality and attacking efficiency

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **football event data combined with visualization techniques** can provide deep insights into both individual and collective performance. The analysis highlights tactical differences, player influence, and strategic strengths and weaknesses, reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making in modern football.
