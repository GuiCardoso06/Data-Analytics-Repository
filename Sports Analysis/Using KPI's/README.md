# Physical Performance Analysis – Matchday 10

This project presents a **post-match physical performance analysis** of football players based on **GPS tracking and heart rate monitoring data**.

The analysis focuses on key **physical performance indicators (KPIs)** and aims to support the **strength and conditioning staff** in decisions related to training load management, recovery strategies, and future planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze individual and positional physical performance
- Identify volume, intensity, and neuromuscular load patterns
- Monitor cardiovascular stress during match play
- Provide actionable insights for load control and recovery planning

---

## 📊 Data Sources

- **GPS tracking data**
- **Heart rate monitoring**
- Match: **Matchday 10**

The data was analyzed both **individually** and **by playing position**.

---

## 🧠 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were analyzed:

- Minutes played
- Total distance covered
- Distance by intensity zones
  - High-intensity distance (Z5 + Z6)
- Maximum speed
- Number of sprints
- Accelerations and decelerations
- Relative distance (m/min)
- Heart rate zones:
  - Z4
  - Z5
  - High-intensity cardiovascular load

---

## 📈 Individual Analysis

Individual player analysis highlights differences in:

- Total physical load
- High-intensity running capacity
- Sprint frequency
- Neuromuscular demands
- Cardiovascular stress

### Key Highlights
- **Highest total distance:** Player 4
- **Highest maximum speed:** Player 6
- **Most time in HR Zone 5:** Player 6
- **Highest number of sprints:** Player 8

---

## 🧩 Positional Analysis

The positional analysis reveals distinct physical profiles:

- **Fullbacks and wingers**
  - Higher high-intensity running volumes
- **Central midfielders**
  - Greater total distance covered
- **Center backs and goalkeepers**
  - Different acceleration and intensity patterns

Statistical summaries include **means and standard deviations by position**.

---

## 📊 Statistical Outputs

- Descriptive statistics per player
- Mean and standard deviation per position
- Tables of maximum and minimum values (≥ 45 minutes played)
- Visualizations of physical and cardiovascular load

---

## 📌 Conclusions

The analysis shows that physical load is unevenly distributed across players:

- Some players experienced **very high physical and cardiovascular demands**
- Others presented lower physical involvement, which may indicate:
  - Tactical role
  - Physical condition
  - Need for workload adjustment

---

## 🏋️ Practical Recommendations

- Reinforce **active recovery protocols** for players with high load
- Monitor cumulative fatigue in high-intensity profiles
- Adjust training plans for players with lower match involvement
- Optimize workload balance to improve future performance
